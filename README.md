# Project Description

This project is a replica of a pokedex found in the cartoon show Pokemon and is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The pokedex will load the pokemon data from an external API. A list of pokemon will be displayed which will show pokemon details if clicked on.

# Project Purpose

The purpose of this web application was to further develop my HTML and CSS skills as well as to dive into my first JavaScript project. The javasciprt portion taught me how to interact and manipulate the DOM, load external an database using an API, as well as build modals and other UI patterns for extra details and functionality.

# How to Run

To run this project I recommend using a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc. You can download the files from my github repository and run the index.html file.
